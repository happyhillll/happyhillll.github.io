# Recital museum

While there has been a lot of archival research on music,there hasn't been much archiving of performances.  
However, music is an experience, and there is no music if it is not performed, so the value of performances is indescribable.I created this visualization to make it easier for performers and audiences to find information about past performances.You can also check out the actual reservation pages in the hyperlink.

Classical music performances are positioned along the month in which they were performed. Now it is visualized by month, but once the data collection is completed, a visualization over the past 10 years will be created.
