# Recital museum

While there has been extensive archival research on music, the archiving of performances has been relatively neglected. Music, fundamentally, is an experience and does not truly exist without performance, making the value of performances immeasurable. I created this visualization to make it easier for performers and audiences to find information about past performances. Additionally, you can check out the actual reservation pages through the provided hyperlinks.

Classical music performances are positioned along the month in which they were performed. Now it is visualized by month, but once the data collection is completed, a visualization over the past 10 years will be created.

You can either zoom with your touchpad or scroll wheel in the areas of the music performances in order to see more details. Click and drag the background in order to adjust the visible area.
